# Navigation Integration for HireHub AI

## Overview

This document provides details on the newly integrated navigation system for the HireHub AI platform. The navigation has been redesigned to provide a consistent user experience across all pages from the four merged repositories.

## Components Added

### 1. Navbar Component

- Located at: `src/components/ui/Navbar.jsx`
- Provides a unified navigation experience across all pages
- Features:
  - Main navigation links to key sections
  - Resources dropdown with links to tools and resources
  - User profile dropdown
  - Notifications center
  - Mobile-responsive design

### 2. PageLayout Component

- Located at: `src/components/layout/PageLayout.jsx`
- Provides consistent layout and spacing for all pages
- Options:
  - `fullWidth`: Removes max-width constraint
  - `noPadding`: Removes default padding
  - `className`: Additional custom classes
  - `containerClassName`: Classes for the inner container

## Implementation Details

### App Structure

- The `App.jsx` component now includes the Navbar by default
- The main content is wrapped in a `<main>` tag with top padding to account for the navbar

### Header Compatibility

- The original `Header.jsx` component now falls back to rendering the Navbar
- This ensures backward compatibility with existing pages

### CSS Additions

- Added `navbar.css` with specialized styles for the navbar components
- Includes animations, dropdowns, and responsive behaviors

## Usage

### Basic Page Template

```jsx
import React from "react";
import PageLayout from "components/layout/PageLayout";

const YourPage = () => {
  return <PageLayout>{/* Your page content here */}</PageLayout>;
};

export default YourPage;
```

### Special Layout Options

```jsx
// For full-width pages with custom padding
<PageLayout fullWidth noPadding className="custom-class">
  {/* Content */}
</PageLayout>
```

## Navigation Structure

The main navigation has been organized into the following sections:

1. **Home** - Landing page and overview
2. **Jobs** - AI-powered job feed and job-related features
3. **Learn** - Educational resources and courses
4. **Practice** - Interview practice and skill development
5. **Network** - Mentorship and networking features
6. **Resources** - Additional tools including:
   - AI Career Coach
   - Resume Builder
   - Resource Library
   - Hackathons & Competitions
   - Virtual Career Fair

## Modifying Navigation

To update the navigation items, edit the `mainNavItems` and `resourceItems` arrays in the Navbar component.
